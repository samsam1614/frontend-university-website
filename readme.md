# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

I have created a Jewellery online shopping site which consists of 3 pages; a home page, shop page and a basket page. My site is aimed at consumers age 35 and above. Based on research the age group 55-64 year are more likely to spend on jewellery, therefore, I made sure my site is easy to use and navigate as well as clear fonts and colours.

# Home page
My home page is very simple. It consists of a hero section that has offers and promotional content which are easy to read and a images bold images. I used a section tag for this. Below I created another section that contains featured products consisting of new items. All the items are placed in one container (div). To display the items in columns and rows I used a flexbox and wrapped the items so that they proceed to the next row.

# Shop page
My shop page begins with a banner sections. Below the banner sections, I have further section that contains all the products available. I have one div container which contains all the products. I have split them into groups e.g. Sets, Earrings, etc. and separated them with headers describing each section. Once again, I displayed them in rows using flex box.

# Basket page
my basket page has two sections one containing a table with table headers and table rows of items added to the basket and a further section for the total and the discount and gift card codes. I displayed them side by side using display: column.

# Responsiveness
I have made my site responsive for all screen sizes and ensured all parts of my site are displayed in a suitable format. This includes both my footer and navbar. For the mobile screen size and tablet, I have adjusted my navbar so that it is displayed downwards and as a hamburger menu. With the help of JavaScript, I made sure the menu is only visible when activated. I also added a cross to close the menu down.
